/* <!-- Front End vs. Back End
Front End: what you see
    - Client Side (building with user in mind)
    - Components(button, input fields, images, etc)
    - Layout/Positioning
    - Run on your browser
    - No servers hosting your code, no databases storing your data
    - Static Website -> Web 1.0 -> contesnt is delivered as it is stored in the files (not in Database)
​
Back End: behind the scenes 
    - Server Side (building the business logic)
    - Setup Database Server (database) (mysql, postgresSQL, oracle)(Mongo)
        - This is a server that hosts a database\
    - Setup an application server (Host your app locally), and your job is to connect your database server to your application server. (Express - JavaScript) (With Python - Flask)
    - Your job as a developer is to creat a model. this model is a file that represents the state of your database. So that data coming into your code can automatically be mapped to your database. 
    
    -> How does Fron-End and Back-End work together
        - Your user interface (which is what you build as a front-end developer) has components, and those components can trigger a transaction on your database. 
​
    Tools:
    Front End: HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, DOM, Jquery, (if we have time, intro to React)
​
    Back End: Package managers (npm, pip( [pip install package] [npm install package] python[pip install django] javascript [pip install react], databases server, (mysql or mongo), application server (express)
